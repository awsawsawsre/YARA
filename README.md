# YARA
High-Level Threat Detection Architecture ( Backend with Python)
***************************************************************

FastAPI (for API and event-driven alerts)
Machine Learning (Isolation Forest, Deep Learning) (for anomaly detection)
SOAR Automation (to trigger responses like isolating hosts)
Threat Hunting Module (YARA, live memory forensics, packet analysis)

Threat Detection Endpoint (/detect-threats) → Uses Isolation Forest ML model to detect anomalies in log data
Automated Response (/isolate-host) → Sends a request to isolate compromised hosts via a mock SOAR API

Memory Scanning (/scan-memory) → Uses YARA rules to detect malicious patterns
Network Monitoring (/network-monitor) → Captures live packets using Scapy


Live Dashboard → React frontend with real-time WebSocket alerts
*****************************************************************
Threat Correlation: Multi-source analysis, MITRE ATT&CK mapping
Automated Playbooks: One-click execution for rapid mitigation
AI-driven Threat Prediction: Real-time anomaly detection
Risk Score Chart → Real-time trend visualization
Refined UI → Improved structure & alerts
Cloud Log Ingestion → Sync logs from AWS/Azure/GCP
SOC Dashboard → Multi-panel view for incidents, logs, and risk analysis
Real-time Collaboration → Incident sharing, analyst notes, case management
